# create what/is/it  # will create dirs 'what' and 'is', with file 'it' inside 'is'


# Other ways to achieve this, the file contains lines of directories and files like we want to create
#deeply/nested/foo/bar.txt
#deeply/nested/baz/fiz.txt
#we then run a shell command that uses the && combinator to group 3 commands that run sequentially -
#the first command stores the file in an environment variable (that gets re-used on the next file pass) using the placeholder we registered before

$ cat files.txt | xargs -I {} sh -c 'f="{}" && mkdir -p -- "${f%/*}" && touch -- "$f"'
#2
$ while read f; do mkdir -p "$(dirname "$f")"; touch "$f"; done < files.txt
